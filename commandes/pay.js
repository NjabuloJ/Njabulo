You can add multiple games to your script. Here are some ideas for games that fit well with a slot machine theme or can be easily integrated into your existing script:
Slot Machine: You've already implemented this. You can add different themes, reels, or winning conditions.
Roulette: A classic casino game where players bet on numbers or colors.
Dice Roll: A simple game where players roll dice and win based on the outcome.
Coin Flip: Heads or tails game where players bet on the outcome.
Guess the Number: Players try to guess a randomly generated number within a certain range.
Blackjack: A card game where players try to get closest to 21 without going over.
Lottery: Players buy virtual tickets with numbers, and a random draw determines the winner.
To add more games, you can:
Create separate functions for each game.
Use a command system to determine which game to play (e.g., .slot, .roulette, .dice, etc.).
Implement game logic and winning conditions for each game.
Some popular game mechanics to consider:
Betting systems
Leaderboards
Jackpots
Bonus features
When adding more games, keep your code organized, and consider using modular design patterns to make it easier to maintain and update your script.
